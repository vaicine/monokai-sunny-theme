# About

Monokai Sunny is essentially the same as [monokai-emacs](https://github.com/oneKelvinSmith/monokai-emacs) with some tweaks to make it a light theme.

# Installation

Download `monokai-sunny-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:

`M-x load-theme RET monokai-sunny`
